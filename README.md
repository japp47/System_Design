# System Design Learning Repository

Welcome to my **System Design** repository! üéâ

As a **beginner**, I‚Äôm diving into the world of system design, where I‚Äôll be learning and sharing my knowledge through this repo. Here, you‚Äôll find content that I will push as I explore concepts, techniques, and best practices. My goal is to understand how to build scalable and efficient systems and document my learning process. Whether you‚Äôre new to system design like me or just curious about what I‚Äôm learning, I hope you find this repository helpful.

## Why this repository?

I created this repo as a place to:
- **Learn by doing**: I‚Äôll be adding different system design concepts, architectures, and patterns as I discover them.
- **Document my journey**: Everything I push will be documented with explanations, diagrams, and examples to solidify my understanding.
- **Share knowledge**: If you‚Äôre starting with system design, you might find this useful to learn alongside me.

## Key Concepts in System Design (Explained Simply)

As I learn, I‚Äôll be covering the following important terms:

### 1. Scalability
Scalability is the ability of a system to handle **increased load**. Imagine a shop: when more customers come in, you either open more counters (scale horizontally) or make your existing counter work faster (scale vertically). Systems need to scale similarly.

### 2. Load Balancer
A load balancer acts like a **traffic controller**. When many users are trying to access a website, the load balancer decides which server should handle which user, so no single server gets overwhelmed.

### 3. Database Sharding
Sharding is like **splitting up a large table** into smaller pieces. Imagine a book too big to read comfortably, so you split it into chapters across several notebooks. It‚Äôs easier to manage, and you can read different parts separately.

### 4. Latency
Latency is the **delay** in getting a response from a system after making a request. Think of it as the time between placing an order in a restaurant and when the food is served.

### 5. Caching
Caching is like using a **shortcut**. If you often look up the same thing, a system stores that information in a place that‚Äôs easy to access quickly, reducing the need to go to the ‚Äúsource‚Äù every time.

### 6. Fault Tolerance
Fault tolerance is how well a system can **keep working** when something goes wrong. For example, if one server goes down, can the system still serve users by using another server without interruptions?

### 7. Consistency
Consistency means that **everyone sees the same data**. Imagine sharing a notepad: if you write something down, the next person reading it should see exactly what you wrote.

### 8. Throughput
Throughput is the **amount of work a system can handle** in a given period. Think of how many cars can pass through a toll booth in one minute. Higher throughput means more cars get through quickly.

### 9. Availability
Availability refers to a system being **operational and accessible** most of the time. For example, think of a 24/7 convenience store that‚Äôs always open and ready to serve customers.

### 10. Microservices
Microservices are like building **many small apps** instead of one big one. Each service does one specific job (like handling payments, user logins, etc.) and works independently. This makes systems easier to maintain and scale.

### 11. Redundancy
Redundancy is having **backup components** in case something fails. Imagine a bridge with multiple lanes: if one lane is closed for repair, cars can still pass using the other lanes. Systems often use extra servers or databases for backup.
